# ReadStream
This repository is for a class project for a database course I took in college. The website is an e-book streaming service. 
This was a semester long group project. The goal of this project was to create a website that would need a database. We used a wordpress website as a base for our front-end. The back-end was managed using PHP, MySQL and a locally hosted database using MAMP/WAMP.
